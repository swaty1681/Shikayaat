# shikayaat
This project is used to raise complaints and queries.

Shikayaat is a digital platform designed to provide users with a convenient and efficient way to lodge complaints with an organization. The system is accessible through a website or mobile application, and users can log in and submit complaints related to various aspects of the organization, such as products, services, or customer support.

The primary objective of the Shikayaat system is to provide a transparent and reliable channel for users to report any issues or concerns them may have with an organization. By providing an easy-to-use interface, the system helps to ensure that complaints are lodged quickly and efficiently, leading to faster resolution times and improved customer satisfaction.

The system's design is based on the principles of user-centricity and user experience. It features a simple and intuitive user interface, which allows users to log in and lodge complaints with ease. The system also provides users with real-time updates on the status of their complaints, ensuring that they are kept informed throughout the process.

One of the key advantages of the Shikayaat system is that it enables organizations to address user complaints more efficiently. By providing a central repository for complaints, the system helps organizations to track and monitor the complaints, ensuring that they are dealt with in a timely and effective manner. This leads to improved customer satisfaction and can help to build trust and confidence in the organization.

Another advantage of the system is that it helps to promote transparency and accountability in organizations. By providing a digital record of complaints and their resolutions, the system helps to ensure that organizations are held accountable for their actions, and that users can access this information when needed.
